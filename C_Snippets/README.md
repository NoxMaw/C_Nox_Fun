### C snippets

These are snippets I have collected or wrote. The most interesting one is most likely 'Hax.c'.

Everything beyond hax.c are just normal functions, I wrote them for practice, however I would like to rework them into generics at some point.

#### Hax.c

Obscure and unusual 'hacks' or shortcuts for common tasks such as:
- Swap integers
- init array with \0 all around
- Create a compound literal variable-lenght array of size n
- Compile-time tree struct
- Null pointer to access the member of struct to get its size at compile time.

#### Array.c

Functions to operate on arrays.

#### Bitwise.c

Bitwise functions and logic notes.


#### DLinkdList.c

Functions to operate on Doubly Linked Lists


#### HashTable.c

Functions to operate on a hash table


#### Int.c

Functions to operate on ints

#### mem.c

Functions to operate on memory.

#### Str.c

Functions to operate on strings.

#### Structs.c

Functions to operate on structs.

#### FunctionPointerTable.c
A Function Pointer Table for a calculator.
