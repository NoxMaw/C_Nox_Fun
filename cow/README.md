### Cow
#### Cow.c
A basic implementation of Cowsay, written from scratch.
Accepts pipes, however does not accept skins and it is not perfectly polished, as the textbox will break if the string is too large, automatic line breaks were not implemented.

If it has no arguments, it will only print the cow.

```cmd
           __n__n__
    .------`-\00/-'
   /  ##  ## (oo)
  / \## __   ./
     |//YY \|/
     |||   |||
