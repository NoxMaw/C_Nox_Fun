Random projects and code snippets I wrote for fun or practice.

### Cow
#### Cow.c
A basic implementation of Cowsay, written from scratch.
Accepts pipes, however does not accept skins and it is not perfectly polished, as the textbox will break if the string is too large, automatic line breaks were not implemented.

If it has no arguments, it will only print the cow.

```cmd
           __n__n__
    .------`-\00/-'
   /  ##  ## (oo)
  / \## __   ./
     |//YY \|/
     |||   |||
```

### MergingLights
#### Merging_lights.c
Personal project of mine, development is currently paused.

It's a chess-like game, currently it only lets you select a piece and move it around the board, handles player turns. Currently has an annoying bug where you must press enter twice at some point before the game starts.

### Advent-of-code-2023
Code for Advent of code 2023.

### C snippets

These are snippets I have collected or wrote. The most interesting one is most likely 'Hax.c'.

Everything beyond hax.c are just normal functions, I wrote them for practice, however I would like to rework them into generics at some point.

#### Hax.c

Obscure and unusual 'hacks' or shortcuts for common tasks I have collected most of these from the internet for study.

Tasks include:
- Swap integers
- init array with \0 all around
- Create a compound literal variable-lenght array of size n
- Compile-time tree struct
- Null pointer to access the member of struct to get its size at compile time.


#### Array.c

Functions to operate on arrays.

#### Bitwise.c

Bitwise functions and logic notes.


#### DLinkdList.c

Functions to operate on Doubly Linked Lists


#### HashTable.c

Functions to operate on a hash table


#### Int.c

Functions to operate on ints

#### mem.c

Functions to operate on memory.

#### Str.c

Functions to operate on strings.

#### Structs.c

Functions to operate on structs.

#### FunctionPointerTable.c
A Function Pointer Table for a calculator.
